    shortDescription: >
        Application aimed at gathering applications
        for public competitions. It is web based and can be
        used both by applicants and by backoffice users.

    longDescription: >
        PCA is a software aimed at gathering applications
        for public competitions. The software is designed not
        to require applicant strong authentication. Submitted
        applications are keyed by the applicant's Italian fiscal
        code. Fiscal code duplications are allowed by the software,
        since otherwise an applicant might be unable to submit when
        her/his fiscal code has been stolen by another fake
        applicant. It is up to the backoffice users to fix fiscal
        code duplications. On application submission, the applicant
        receives a PIN, which allows her/him to possibly update
        her/his application later on. In case the PIN gets lost, the
        applicant can submit new applications from scratch. Also
        in this case, a fiscal code duplication occurs and must be
        fixed. Applications are never deleted. In case of application
        update, the old version is marked logically deleted. All
        actions are logged, even fiscal code matches. The
        software has been designed to tolerate an high load from
        the users and can store an ideally unlimited number of
        applications. The software is composed of a backend
        (based on Asp.Net WebApi2), a frontend GUI (dedicated
        to applicants) and a backoffice GUI (dedicated to
        backoffice users). The frontend is based on Angular6
        framework and Material design. The backoffice is based
        on Angular6 framework and Bootstrap v4.
        The system is compliant with security by-design and by-default
        enforced by GDPR regulation. The backoffice GUI is protected
        through a token-based JWT authentication. Real-time statistics
        on submitted application are available from the backoffice.
        Implementation of a Denial of Service (DoS) reaction mechanism
        is planned (basically based on IP client identity). The
        reaction enforces a binary exponential backoff delay on every
        request coming from a DoS IP address.
